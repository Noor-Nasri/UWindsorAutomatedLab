Automation program for a postdoc's research in OFETs at the Univeristy of Windsor. Using different organic conducting layers, researchers in her team would need to examine the mobility and threshold voltage each OFET device would have to determine how effective each formula is. This program automates the calculations to derive these figures in a much more time efficient manner. 

Libraries used:
 - matplotlib
 - xlsxwriter
 - xlrd
 - numpy
